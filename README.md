This is my attempt to create a famous Battleship game. 
The repository contains a simpler version to run from the command line and a GUI version using the PyGame library.
Both versions work as intended. I'm looking forward to add comments on less obvious parts of the code. 
It would also be appropriate to add a Ship class to the game to conveniently pass information if the attacked ship has been completely destroyed, which would enrich the opponent's logic and give information to the player as well.
